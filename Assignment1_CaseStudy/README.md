## Overview and Origin

Name of company: Robinhood Markets Inc
                 Robinhood Financial LLC

Company was incorporated on April 18, 2013

The founders of the company are Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev

The online brokerage landscape prior to Robinhood was dominated by big brokers controlling the market. The big brokerage firms E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Interactive Brokers would not allow the price of commissions to fall. Their business model for making money relied on their commissions. Before Robinhood all had heavy trading commissions between the $5 to $10 range. In addition to the fees, brokers required a minimum deposit of $2,000 to open an account. None of these brokers refused to drop their pricing and did not try to compete with each other. This not only frustrated investors but kept many out of the financial markets. 

In 2011 the tech landscape was evolving. Brokers started rolling out Iphone and Android apps for trading. Not only did you not have to go to the stock exchange to make a trade, you can do it from your mobile device. Also in 2011 there was a massive stigma put on Wall Street and the field of investments. There were protests called Occupy Wall Street, burning the numbers 1% and 99% in millions of American minds. These protests were mostly caused by the bailouts investment banks received. Not only was it hard to profit by $20 round trip trade, investment brokers were on TV saying we are the 1%. This chaos created an opportunity or a demand for someone to step in for the everyday person and combate Wall Street. The founders of Robinhood set out to change the stigma and level the playing field, by creating the first no trade commission app. They also wanted to inpower the everyday investors with the tools to make sufficient investments. They wanted to democratize finance for everyone with no account minimums. 

The company was funded through venture capital-backed funding. They have completed six rounds of funding to date. Their first seed investment was for $3 million dollars. The investment was from Index, Google Ventures, Andreesseen. They then proceeded to A-G funding rounds. 
Series A round September 23, 2014 for $13 million
Series B round May 7, 2015 for $50 million
Series C round April 28, 2017 for $110 million
Series D round May 10, 2018 for $363 million
Series E round July 22, 2019 for $323 million
Series F round May 4, 2020 for $280 million
Series G round September 22, 2020 for $660 million

Robinhood total valuation is $11.7 billion.

## Business Activities:

The company is trying to solve specific problems. They want to disrupt the investment management sector. As mentioned before they are trying to level the playing field to lower commissions and give users the tools needed to succeed in self investing. The company is also giving young users a chance to grow their savings.

Also Robinhood added the trading of cryptocurrencies. They are the only platform that currently allows trading of them alongside stocks and options. Like when the major brokers took hold of high commissions in stock market trading, the major brokers in cryptocurrency charge massive fees. Robinhood is trying to disrupt that industry now also. 

Robinhood’s original goal was to democratize finance for everyone. They wanted everyone to have access to the financial markets but the company originally targeted the millennial generation.. The millennial generation is anyone born between 1981 and 1996, which is an average age of 23-38. Which accounts for two billion people. 



The solution that robinhood offers is commission free trades on stocks and options. They utilize the cost efficiency of mobile software. They put the basic tools on their mobile app for users to use. Before Robinhood the other brokers put most of their development into computer based software. Robinhood launched as a mobile app platform. They do not have the same customer service and call centers as the other brokers though.

They also utilize the money management system of allowing users to access a debit card linked to their account. Which allows users to use it as a bank account. They can spend money out their account without transferring into another bank. 

Robinhood also added cryptocurrencies to be traded. They are the only broker that allows both stock and crypto trading. There are no commissions either. All the crypto platforms charge significant fees on buying and selling.

Robinhood was built to use on a mobile device, unlike the competitors in the domain. They made the app to be addicting. Users cannot put it down. They used the strategy that worked for Facebook, Twitter, and other social media apps. It's a user friendly app that people cannot turn off.  

   
Robinhood utilizes many technologies as listed belowThey specifically mention how they made an event-driven architectural pattern. According to the company it is used for the accounting system. Python is the programming language combined with Django for API connectivity. Also Python is used to better handle the massive amount of data libraries. Django is used for better flow and handling the large amount of users on the Robinhood platform. React JS and Redux are used to handle the massive amount of data and order flow in the application that is constantly changing. They use Kafka for the import and export of real time-data. Airflow is used to import directories and better easy workflow. All these together provide the application to handle the data for millions of users and allow for future growth. While there is a long list of technologies used these were the most important.

The technologies Robinhood use for application and data are:
Python, NGINX, React, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu, Redis, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, Kafka, Go, RabbitMQ, Swift, Memcached, Kotlin, Django REST Framework, Celery, Airflow, Rxjaval, Faust

They use business tools:
Slack, G Suite, Confluence, Asana

Their DevOps are: 
Github, Docker, Jenkins Kubernetes, Webpack, Kibana, Babel, Sentry, Vagrant, Grafana, Terraform, Logstash, Prometheus, Consul, Zookeeper, ELK, Vault, Fabric, Salt, StatsD, Phabricator, Sensu, LXC

The utilities used are:
Google Analytics, Elasticsearch, Retrofit.



## Landscape:



Robinhood doamin: Financial Software, Brokerage, Cash Management, and Cryptocurrencies

#

Over the last 10 years different innovations in technology have changed the financial software domain. It is more like an open source community now. With the rise in social networking companies Facebook, Twitter, Discord, and Slack the access of information is easier to react to than before. This also created trading communities where everyday people can share ideas about the marketplace and learn from each other. The everyday person now has the same real-time news as the trader that works in a brokerage house. People also can share applications on market analysis or collaborate to form new apps. People in general can now be fully educated in the financial markets. Many people found an interest, hobby, job, or friend through these networking portals. 

The further development of the smartphone has allowed for information on the go. Anyone at any time has the ability to access live-streaming stock quotes and news. They have the ability to buy or sell stocks at any time. In the early 2000’s trades had to be called into a brokerage house to execute. This has also helped market volatility. People can react to the news when it happens rather than going through a middle-man and taking up much precious time to execute a trade. 

Data analytics, AI,  machine learning have also been a big innovation in the domain. Through these breakthroughs it has been easier for the Securities and Exchange Commision to effectively monitor market activity. In 2020 the SEC has had the least amount of insider trading cases, since 1996. An article in NPR stated “insider trading made up less than 4% of the commission's enforcement work that year, another decades-long low.” Also SEC chairman Jay Clayton said “Data Analytics more important than ever” in an SEC keynote remark. [(https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/clayton-keynote-mid-atlantic-regional-conference-2019)] 

Data Analytics, AI, machine-learning has helped hedge funds and traders.The data of stock history and real-time market conditions can pinpoint whether or not a certain stock is a buy or sell. This lowers the risk and maximizes the return. Most hedge funds load market data into an algorithm with a set of rules to make the trades for them. This not only maximizes returns in the market but also saves the company money on employee cost. The algorithm can trade faster and more frequently than a human user. It is estimated over 80 percent of the market is controlled by algorithmic trading. It is estimated that 90 percent of traders fail because of human emotion. It is more efficient for AI to monitor the trends, since price can change quickly. 

Commission free brokers is the biggest innovation. It brings more people into the trading market thus creating more volatility. It also brings a social aspect, with more everyday people following the market. It gives users more freedom to execute trades without having to worry about covering commission costs. 




The major companies in the financial software and brokerage domain are: 
TD Ameritrade 
E-Trade
Charles Schwab
Fidelity
Interactive Brokers
Merrill Edge

## Results



The business impact has been big on the financial markets and on large brokerage houses. Novice investors can now compete at a similar level to the professional investors. This has caused a lot of uproar among billionaire investors and hedge funds. Especially since the recent shutdowns with Robinhood users watching the market daily. Axios stated in an article “While many have wagged their fingers at what they see as overconfident and underprepared youngsters day trading on their smartphones, the stock market's new school — a collection of sports bettors, the newly unemployed, Reddit aficionados and eager young investors — is growing into a force on Wall Street.”  [(https://www.axios.com/robinhood-effect-young-investors-c4acb5e8-ecc3-4d0d-a193-d125fdf075e4.html)] They also stated that Robinhood users are beating the money managers. It proves most people can do their own investing and do not need a professional to do it.

The big brokerage houses have been forced to change their long standing business model. They have lowered their commissions to zero and  account minimums to compete. They have advanced their mobile apps for trading and money transfers. Robinhood has lived up to its name, robbing the rich brokerage houses and giving it to the people.


The core metric of success for online brokers is through the amount of users. Every company profit is in the average daily user volume. They gain revenue through order flow, margin loans,  and subscription fees. The companies also need th

Robinhood has out performed at the top out of all other brokers in terms of average daily users and new customer additions. In July Robinhood had 4.3 million daily active users. TD Ameritrade was the closest at 3.84 million average daily users.


Robinhood is outproforming its competitors in the domain. They have more daily active users than its competition. They have also added more users than everyone else. They have successfully adapted a subscription package for $5 per month, called Robinhood Gold. This grants the users more in depth market data, margin loans, and pre market/ after hours trades. They have also added cryptocurrency trading to the platform, a feature no other broker in the domain has added.


## Recommendations



I would advise Robinhood to add an artificial intelligence and machine-learning integration. The feature would learn for the everyday market data to better the decision making in AI executing trades. None of the other major brokerage companies have adapted this feature. Since Robinhood users are more non-professional traders, this will help their winning percentage. It could also generate more revenue for the company because more trades will be made.

I would also advise a feature that uses chart comparison. This would be a great feature to allow users to compare two or more companies charts to recognize a pattern of trends. This will help users make decisions and take more risk out of trade. It is also educational to the user to better understand charts.

Adding both of these features would benefit the company significantly. This will not only add more users but could add more revenue if packaged into a subscription based service. Especially with AI, the results should pay for a subscription fee. 



Additional technologies that the service would utilize are Tensorflow, Numpy, and  Scikit-Learn.


These technologies work best together for machine-learning. Scikit-Learn and Numpy work well together because of the large amount of data needed in a library. They can also handle the complex equations to process the data.
